 *   { sort: 'first ASC' }
 *

 *   field in ascending order.

/**
 * This function should use axios to make a POST request to the following url:
 *   https://api.comp426.com/a08/users
 *
 * The POST HTTP verb is conventionally used when instructing the server to
 *   create a new record in the database. The new record's data is traditionally
 *   passed to the server through POST parameters. Here, your task is to create
 *   a new "user" that represents you. The new record should have three
 *   non-empty fields: "first", "last", and "onyen".
 *
 * Example POST parameters:
 *   {
 *      first: 'Ketan',
 *      last:  'Mayer-Patel',
 *      onyen: 'kmp',
 *   }
 *
 * Note: Making a POST request to this URL does not actually create a new record
 *   in the server database (it's just pretend), so don't worry about breaking
 *   things or making an account that conflicts with yours.
 *
 * The axios request should be "await"ed, and once the response is available,
 *   the entire response object should be returned.
 *
 * @returns  {Object}  The complete axios response object

/**
 * Sometimes, the server isn't able to fulfill a request. In this case, it may
 *   respond with a 4XX or 5XX HTTP error code. The request made in fn3() will
 *   be rejected by the server if "first", "last", or "onyen" are missing or
 *   blank. This function should demonstrate that behavior by making another
 *   "create user" request to the server that omits one or more of these
 *   parameters. However, your function should catch the error in a try/catch
 *   block.
 *
 * The axios request should be "await"ed, and once the response is available,
 *   the entire response object should be returned. If the request fails (which
 *   it should), return the entire error object instead.
 *
 * @returns  {Object}  The complete axios response object if the request
 *                     succeeds, or the complete axios error object if the
 *                     request fails
